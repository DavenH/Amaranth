# Refactor Notes

## Cycle 2 OpenGL Cable Tessellation

The prototype GL cable renderer exposed platform-dependent artifacts with wide
`GL_LINE_STRIP` strokes and hand-built triangle strips: square cutouts on
curves, disappearing vertical sections, and poor selected-line readability.
Cycle 2 currently keeps cables on the JUCE path renderer while the background
remains OpenGL-backed.

Suggested direction:

- Re-enable GL cables only after adding a real stroked-path tessellator that
  emits joins, caps, and dash runs as explicit geometry.
- Treat selection as a separate narrow highlight stroke rather than by making
  the halo heavily opaque.
- Keep node shells and node contents in the same render layer unless the whole
  node widget moves to GL, because split shell/content rendering breaks
  overlap z-order.
